} /*Some explanation here: initially, this class was called "fade". However, when I started implementing
the Bootstrap the slideshow was not working properly, in the sense that when the slide was changing to the next image
it will go blank and then image will show. How did I fix it? Well, thanks to 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56557784/cant-implement-the-w3schools-slideshow-in-bootstrap
I was able to understand that the Bootstrap ahs a fade class built in it...and the problem I was having was
the fade class in it was sort of colliding with my fade class. So, the solution was to rename my fade class
to a new name (i.e. "fade-in"). */
